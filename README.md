# CPSC 310 Project: UBC Query Engine

This is a UBC Query Engine. This project was separate into two key tasks:

1. Parse data from HTML files and create JSON files that can be queried.
2. Create a query engine with the parsed data.

This was a partner project, with a TA serving as the Scrum master for bi-weekly meetings.
